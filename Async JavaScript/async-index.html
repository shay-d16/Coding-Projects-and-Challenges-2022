<!--AYNCHRONOUS:
    Functions running in parallel with other functions are called ASYNCHRONOUS.
    Asynchronous programming is relevant to JavaScript because developers are often making requests
    to servers elsewhere and it can take a couple seconds to get your data back, for instance, so you 
    not want to stall your program until you get that data back; you want the programto keep running 

    CALLBACKS:
    This is where callbacks come in. A CALLBACK is a function passed as an argument to another function
    This technique allows a function to call another function. A callback function can run after another
    function has finished.

    PROMISES:
    "Producing code" is code that can take some time. "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the
    result. A PROMISE is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code. It's a more
    elegant way to handle asynchronous data.

    ASYNC/AWAIT:
    "Async and await make promises easier to write." ASYNC makes a function return a Promise. AWAIT
    makes a function wait for a Promise. The keyword async before a function makes the function return
    a promise. The keyword await before a function makes the function wait for a promise. -->
