// Here, we are going to mimick blog posts on a server, getting them and then creating a blog post.

// First we'll create an array called 'posts' with teo objects:
const posts = [
    { title: 'Post One', body: 'This is post one' },
    { title: 'Post Two', body: 'This is post two' }
];

// Remember, we are mimicking a request to fetch info from a server, and that could take a couple seconds
function getPosts() {
    //The 'setTimeout()' method takes in a callback function as well as a number of milliseconds
    setTimeout();
}
